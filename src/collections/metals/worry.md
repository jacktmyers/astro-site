### The short description I wrote for this project:

It is hard to find a reason to create beyond the enjoyment of the process. For my projects preceding this, I would create a metal object that I enjoyed visually, but served no symbolic purpose. This instance was different. I often struggle with ruminating, tossing nervous thoughts in my head with no purpose. This piece served as a physical manifestation of this cycle, with the purpose of developing healthier strategies to dealing with worries. The raised cup is not attached to the base to allow for removal and the symbolic disposal of those thoughts. They can collect within the vessel until it is time to properly put them to rest. Many of my projects incorporate curves, and organic shapes, tied to hard and rigid lines. For this project, I tried to lean more towards the free-flowing elements of metal. This is exemplified in the twists towards the top of the stand and the spirals at the base. From the beginning I knew I wanted to in some way capture the movement of water, so as to symbolize the flowing of the thoughts from their conception and into the past. 

If I could recreate this piece there are many things I would change. Initially I planned to incorporate another raised form at the base to mirror the vessel, however, given the time constraints, I opted against this. Additionally the spirals towards the bottom could have been more carefully assembled. Within the spirals still lie remnants from the pickling process that I could not remove. Also the vessel has a small tumor on one of the sides that annoys me, but that is a worry, and I have a place to put those.
