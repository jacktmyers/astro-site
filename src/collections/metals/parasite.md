For this piece I found a model train at a thrift shop and assorted pieces of bark and leaves. My goal was to cast a piece that had both pieces of nature and technology combined. In the end, with some suggestions, I decided to make a sort of prong setting for a real piece of bark. The industrial tumor has grown to encase the piece of bark.
