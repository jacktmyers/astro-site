This metal sculpture is made of copper, but I can’t remember the type of stone that I set (whoops). Each of Ralph's arms and legs interface with the base by a kind of mortise and tenon joint. I did this because I needed the legs to remain equally spaced while soldering. Also I’ve seen this type of joint used in woodworking and I wanted to see if it was useful in metal.
