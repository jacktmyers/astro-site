This is a gift I made for m’lady. I wanted to make something that she could fidget with, hence why it spins. The spinning bit is a sheet of brass sandwiched with two silver cast pieces. These silver pieces were cast in cuddle fish bone giving it the texture. I didn’t even know these things existed until I was pouring molten metal into its corpse. RIP.
