This piece is a lost wax cast, which means the hand was originally crafted in wax and then cast in bronze. The set stone is a cut piece of yellow glass.

To try to make a proportional hand I measured my fingers and palm and used the ratio to cut little blocks of wax to then carve. I assembled those pieces into the little wax hand seen below:
