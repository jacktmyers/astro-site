This is a hollow form vessel that is supposed to light up (someday I will finish it). In my head this atomic powered device exists in a future where functionality trumps safety. On the bottom it says “Achtung,” meaning caution in german. On the inside there are labels telling the user where the fuel cells are, and the ridges on the top prevent it from rolling on a table.

My main inspiration for this was the Curta mechanical calculator, reactor control rods, and sci-fi movie props.
