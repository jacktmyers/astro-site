### At work I created an augmented reality demo to be used with the Hololens 2 and the Magic Leap 2. The tech stack I used was:

- Unity 3D
- Mixed Reality Toolkit 3 (MRTK3)
- Vuforia Engine

The coolest feature in the demo was the 3D object detection. I used Vuforia to accomplish this, which requires a 3D model of the object you wish to detect.

Another team scanned my objects and put together a CAD model. I then took that model and colored it for details using Blender. A few other models were scanned but the multimeter performed the best because of its many intricate details. Here is a video of me testing the detection from my webcam.

To cover my butt I am going to leave the rest out. Here are just a few other photos:
